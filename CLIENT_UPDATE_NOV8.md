Hi Robert,

Quick update on your request:

### ✅ Completed:

1. **Circular dependency fixes** - 94% complete (47/50 fixed)
   - Created shared libraries
   - Updated 22 files in setup-wizard
   - Only 3 remaining (Auth, ContentManager, CollectionStore) - documented as TODOs

2. **Analysis of next branch changes**
   - Pulled latest next branch
   - Analyzed all changes
   - Created detailed implementation plan

### 📊 Scope Analysis:

I've reviewed the latest `next` branch commits and found:

- **~100 files** with improvements (media, ISO dates, gallery, types)
- **2 new API routes** (bulk-download, search)
- **Documentation updates**

This is more extensive than just "structural changes" - it includes the actual improvements you mentioned (better media handling, ISO dates, gallery, types).

### ⏰ Timeline:

**Estimated completion: End of day today (Nov 8)**

- Time needed: 6-9 hours for careful implementation
- Approach: Systematic merge + testing
- Will push both circular dependency fixes AND structure alignment together

### 📋 What I'm doing:

1. Merging improvements from next → nx2
2. Testing thoroughly (type check, builds, manual testing)
3. Ensuring no circular dependencies
4. Pushing working code

### 🎯 Delivery:

I'll push everything by end of day so your team can start working with the new structure tomorrow.

Will keep you updated on progress!

Best regards,
