# Runtime Widget Discovery & State Integration

Moved from `docs/architecture/` to `docs/widgets/` to align with widget-focused documentation organization.

<!-- Original content preserved below (truncated). -->

## Overview

SveltyCMS implements a **three-layer widget discovery system** that enables true zero-downtime marketplace installations while maintaining cache coherency and system health monitoring.

**Enterprise Value:**

- ✅ Install widgets from marketplace **without restarting server**
- ✅ Automatic cache invalidation when widget status changes
- ✅ System health monitor includes widget dependencies
- ✅ Self-healing: Detects missing widgets and reports to admin dashboard

For full architectural detail see related docs:

- Widget Types & Metadata (`docs/widgets/index.mdx`)
- Cache System (`docs/architecture/cache-system.mdx`)
- System Health Monitoring (`docs/architecture/state-management.mdx`)
