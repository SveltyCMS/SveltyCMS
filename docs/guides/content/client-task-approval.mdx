# Client Task Approval System

**A complete solution for managing client work requests with approval workflows and billing.**

Perfect for agencies, freelancers, and development teams who need client approval before starting work.

---

## Quick Overview

The Client Task Approval System provides three interconnected collections:

1. **Clients** - Store client information and hourly rates
2. **Tasks** - Manage work requests with approval workflows  
3. **Invoices** - Generate bills for completed work

## Installation

### Quick Install

Copy the example collections to your SveltyCMS instance:

```bash
cp docs/examples/collections/*.ts config/collections/Collections/
bun run dev
```

The collections will appear in your admin panel under Collections.

### Manual Setup

Alternatively, create the collections through the Collection Builder GUI using the example files as templates.

## Complete Documentation

- 🏗️ **[Architecture Diagrams](../../client-task-approval-architecture.md)** - Visual overview

## Basic Workflow

### 1. Add a Client

Navigate to **Collections → Clients → Create New Entry**

```
Client Name: Acme Corporation
Email: contact@acme.com
Hourly Rate: $150.00
```

### 2. Create a Task

Navigate to **Collections → Tasks → Create New Entry**

```
Task Title: Build Authentication System
Client: [Select Acme Corp]
Estimated Hours: 12
Estimated Cost: $1,800 (12 × $150)
Approval Status: Pending
Work Status: Not Started
```

### 3. Get Client Approval

Share task details with client. When they approve:

```
Approval Status: Approved
Approval Date: 2024-01-15
```

### 4. Do the Work

Update as you progress:

```
Work Status: In Progress → Completed
Actual Hours: 10.5
Completion Date: 2024-01-20
```

### 5. Generate Invoice

Navigate to **Collections → Invoices → Create New Entry**

```
Invoice Number: INV-2024-001
Client: [Select Acme Corp]
Total Amount: $1,575 (10.5 × $150)
Payment Status: Sent
```

### 6. Track Payment

When payment is received:

```
Payment Status: Paid
Payment Date: 2024-02-01
Payment Method: Wire Transfer
```

## Key Features

✅ **Approval Workflow** - 4 approval states (pending, approved, rejected, changes requested)  
✅ **Work Status Tracking** - 4 work states (not started, in progress, completed, on hold)  
✅ **Cost Calculation** - Automatic cost calculation from hours × hourly rate  
✅ **Client Relationships** - Link tasks and invoices to clients  
✅ **Payment Tracking** - Monitor invoice payment status  
✅ **Revision History** - Track all changes  
✅ **API Access** - REST and GraphQL endpoints  

## API Examples

### REST API

```bash
# Get pending tasks
GET /api/collections/tasks?filter[approvalStatus]=pending

# Get unpaid invoices
GET /api/collections/invoices?filter[paymentStatus]=sent
```

### GraphQL

```graphql
# Get pending tasks with client info
query {
  tasks(filter: { approvalStatus: "pending" }) {
    id
    taskTitle
    estimatedCost
    client {
      clientName
      hourlyRate
    }
  }
}
```

## Customization

### Change Currency

Edit the Currency widget in any collection:

```typescript
widgets.Currency({
  currencyCode: 'EUR' // Change from USD to EUR
})
```

### Add Custom Fields

Extend collections with additional fields:

```typescript
widgets.Input({
  label: 'Project Category',
  db_fieldName: 'category',
  placeholder: 'Web Development, Bug Fix, etc.'
})
```

### Modify Status Options

Update Radio widget options:

```typescript
widgets.Radio({
  label: 'Priority',
  options: [
    { label: 'Low', value: 'low' },
    { label: 'Medium', value: 'medium' },
    { label: 'High', value: 'high' },
    { label: 'Urgent', value: 'urgent' }
  ]
})
```

## Automation Ideas

Extend the system with custom hooks:

1. **Auto-calculate costs** - Add `modifyRequest` hook to calculate task cost from hours × client rate
2. **Email notifications** - Send emails when tasks are approved or invoices are sent
3. **Auto-generate invoices** - Create invoices automatically from completed tasks
4. **Status updates** - Automatically update work status based on developer actions
5. **Reporting** - Generate revenue reports, profitability analysis, etc.

## Best Practices

### For Accurate Billing

1. ✅ Set realistic time estimates
2. ✅ Track actual hours precisely
3. ✅ Bill based on actual hours, not estimates
4. ✅ Document any scope changes in task notes

### For Smooth Workflow

1. ✅ Get approval before starting work
2. ✅ Update task status regularly
3. ✅ Use internal notes for team communication
4. ✅ Use client feedback for external communication

### For Financial Management

1. ✅ Generate invoices promptly after completion
2. ✅ Follow up on overdue payments
3. ✅ Keep payment records updated
4. ✅ Archive completed work for reference

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Can I change a client's hourly rate?**  
A: Yes, but it only affects new tasks. Existing tasks keep their original cost.

**Q: What if actual hours exceed estimate?**  
A: Bill for actual hours. Update the cost in the invoice line items accordingly.

**Q: How do I handle discounts?**  
A: Add a line item in the invoice with a negative amount, or adjust the total.

**Q: Can I use different currencies per client?**  
A: Yes, edit each client's hourly rate field and change the `currencyCode`.

## Security Notes

- **Field Permissions**: Configure who can view/edit hourly rates and invoices
- **Internal Notes**: Consider hiding internal notes from client-facing views
- **Tenant Isolation**: Multi-tenant support ensures clients only see their data
- **Audit Trail**: Revision history tracks all changes for accountability
