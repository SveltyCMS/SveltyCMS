# GDPR Compliance Suite

**Status:** ✅ **Available (v1.1)**
**Updated:** 2026-02-17

## Overview

SveltyCMS includes a native **GDPR Compliance Suite** that automates the most complex requirements of privacy regulation: **Right to Erasure (Article 17)** and **Data Portability (Article 20)**.

Unlike plugins in other CMSs, this is a core service integrated directly with the **Audit Log** system, ensuring that even when a user is deleted, the _integrity_ of the content history is preserved (crypto-chained logs) while the _identity_ is anonymized.

### User Self-Service

Users can manage their data directly from their **Profile Page** (`/user`).

- **Download My Data**: Triggers an immediate JSON export of profile and logs.
- **Delete Account**: Triggers a self-service anonymization request.

### Administrator Control

Navigate to **Config** -> **System Settings** -> **Privacy & GDPR** for system-wide controls.

### 1. Data Portability (Export)

System Administrators can generate a full JSON export of all data associated with a specific User ID.

- **Input:** User ID
- **Output:** JSON file containing:
  - User Profile (Email, Role, Preferences)
  - Audit Log History (All actions performed by this user)
  - Metadata (Export timestamp)

```typescript
import { gdprService } from '$services/GDPRService';

// Generates a JSON export of all user data
const userData = await gdprService.exportUserData(userId);
```

### 2. Right to Erasure (Anonymization)

Permanently remove a user's Personal Identifiable Information (PII) without breaking content relationships.

- **Action:** `soft-delete`
- **Process:**
  1.  User email is replaced with `deleted-HASH@anonymized.sveltycms.com`.
  2.  Username is replaced with `ghost-HASH`.
  3.  Auth credentials are revoked.
  4.  **Audit Trail:** A final log entry records the erasure request.
  5.  **Content:** Posts/Entries remain remaining but authorship is transferred to a system "Ghost User" or anonymized, preserving content integrity while removing PII.
  6.  **Logs:** Audit logs are cryptographically immutable but the actor's mapping is anonymized.

```typescript
import { gdprService } from '$services/GDPRService';

// Anonymizes user and logs the erasure request
await gdprService.anonymizeUser(userId, 'User initiated deletion');
```

## Privacy & Cookies

SveltyCMS includes a native **Cookie Consent Plugin** (`src/plugins/cookie-consent`) that provides a headless, accessible banner. It blocks non-essential scripts (Analytics, Marketing) until explicit consent is given, complying with the ePrivacy Directive.

- **Necessary**: Always enabled (Session/Security).
- **Analytics**: Optional (Performance tracking).
- **Marketing**: Optional (Personalization).

## Audit Trail

All GDPR requests (Export, Erasure) are strictly logged in the **Audit Log** to prove compliance to regulators if requested.

## Industry Comparison

How SveltyCMS compares to other platforms for GDPR implementation:

| CMS            | Right to Erasure                                     | Data Portability                   | Audit Proof                |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **SveltyCMS**  | **✅ Automated Service** <br>(Cascading Soft-Delete) | **✅ Native JSON Export**          | **✅ Crypto-Chained Logs** |
| **WordPress**  | ✅ Native Tools <br>(Requires Admin Email Flow)      | ✅ Native Export <br>(Email-based) | ❌ No Native Audit Log     |
| **Payload**    | ⚠️ Custom Hook <br>(Requires Dev Implementation)     | ❌ No Native Export                | ❌ No Native Audit Log     |
| **Drupal**     | ✅ Modules Available <br>(GDPR Module)               | ✅ Modules Available               | ⚠️ Database Logging Only   |
| **Strapi**     | ⚠️ Manual / Plugin <br>(Community Plugins)           | ⚠️ Manual API                      | 💲 Enterprise Only         |
| **Contentful** | ⚠️ Manual API <br>(Scripting required)               | ⚠️ Manual API                      | 💲 Enterprise Only         |

**Why it matters:**

- **WordPress** relies on email confirmation loops which can be slow.
- **Payload** is "code-first" which means _you_ have to write the GDPR logic (handlers, endpoints) yourself.
- **Drupal** has strong module support but requires heavy configuration and maintenance.
- **Strapi/Contentful** force developers to write custom scripts to find and delete user data across relations.
- **SveltyCMS** handles this via a single service call (`gdprService.anonymizeUser`) that automatically handles the "Referential Integrity" of keeping content while removing the user.
