# Setup Wizard Guide

The SveltyCMS Setup Wizard is an interactive installer that runs the first time you launch the application. It guides you through connecting your database, creating an admin account, and selecting a **Solution Preset** to jumpstart your project.

## 🚀 The Setup Process

### 1. Database Configuration

SveltyCMS is database-agnostic. You can choose between:

- **MongoDB** (Recommended for flexibility)
- **MariaDB / MySQL**
- **PostgreSQL** (Beta)

Enter your connection string or host details. The wizard will automatically test the connection before proceeding.

### 2. Admin Account

Create your first super-admin user. This user will have full access to all system settings.

### 3. System Settings

Configure basic site details:

- **Site Name**: Displayed in the admin bar.
- **Language**: Default system and content language.

## 📦 Solution Presets (Starter Kits)

Presets are pre-configured collections of schemas, widgets, and settings designed for specific use cases. Selecting a preset copies standard schema files into your `config/collections` directory, saving you hours of setup time.
