- Size checking (50 MB limit)
- Instant error feedback

**Upload Chunking:**

- Large files uploaded in chunks (coming soon)

**Network Optimization:**

- XMLHttpRequest with progress events
- Automatic retry on network errors
- Timeout handling (30 seconds)

### Gallery Performance

**Lazy Loading:**

- Images load only when visible (Intersection Observer)
- Thumbnail sizes optimized (sm, md, lg)
- Progressive JPEG support
- WebP/AVIF format conversion

**Virtual Scrolling:**

- Only renders visible items (handles 10,000+ files)
- Smooth scrolling performance
- Automatic item recycling
- Memory-efficient

**Client-Side Filtering:**

- No server round trips for search/filter
- Instant results (<50ms for 1000 files)

**Image Optimization:**

```typescript
// Automatic sizes generated on upload:
thumbnails: {
  tiny: { width: 64, height: 64 },   // Grid tiny view
  sm: { width: 256, height: 256 },    // Grid small view
  md: { width: 512, height: 512 },    // Grid medium view
  lg: { width: 1024, height: 1024 }   // Grid large view
}
```

**Caching Strategy:**

- Browser cache for thumbnails (1 year)
- CDN integration for cloud storage
- Service worker caching (optional)
- ObjectURL cleanup on component unmount

## Best Practices

### File Naming

**Do:**

- Use descriptive names: `blog-header-autumn-2024.jpg`
- Include dates: `product-photo-2024-11-07.png`
- Use hyphens or underscores: `team-photo-john-smith.jpg`

**Don't:**

- Special characters: `photo@#$.jpg`
- Spaces: `my photo.jpg` (becomes `my_photo.jpg`)
- Very long names (>100 characters)

### File Organization

**Strategy 1: By Type**

```
images/
documents/
videos/
audio/
```

**Strategy 2: By Project**

```
blog-posts/
marketing-campaigns/
product-catalogs/
```

**Strategy 3: By Date**

```
2024/
  11-november/
    01-blog-post/
    15-newsletter/
```

### Upload Workflow

1. **Prepare Files**
   - Resize images to appropriate dimensions
   - Compress if possible (browser does additional compression)
   - Rename with descriptive names

2. **Batch Similar Files**
   - Upload related files together
   - Use consistent naming within batch
   - Assign to correct folder immediately

3. **Review Before Upload**
   - Check file list in modal
   - Remove unwanted files
   - Verify file types and sizes

4. **Monitor Progress**
   - Watch progress bar
   - Don't navigate away during upload
   - Check for error messages

5. **Verify Upload**
   - Gallery refreshes automatically
   - New files appear in current folder
   - Thumbnails generate in background

### Performance Tips

**For Large Galleries:**

- Use table view with pagination
- Enable filters to reduce visible items
- Use folders to organize (limit to <500 files per folder)
- Consider archiving old media

**For Slow Connections:**

- Upload smaller file sizes
- Use remote URLs when possible
- Upload during off-peak hours
- Enable "low data mode" (coming soon)

**For Fast Uploads:**

- Stable internet connection
- Multiple files in single batch (not multiple batches)
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Use wired connection over Wi-Fi
