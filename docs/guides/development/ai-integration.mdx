# AI Integration & WebMCP Support

SveltyCMS 2026 is designed to integrate with a centralized **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server to empower the built-in AI Assistant with deep project knowledge.

> [!NOTE]
> **Status:** The remote knowledge core at `mcp.sveltycms.com` is currently under development and is not yet active. The AI Assistant currently relies on its internal knowledge base and local Ollama inference.

## Overview

The system architecture supports a **Remote Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. Instead of hosting a heavy vector database inside each CMS instance, the CMS is prepared to query a centralized Knowledge Core.

## Architecture

### 1. The Remote Knowledge Core

Hosted at `mcp.sveltycms.com`, this service:

- **Indexes Documentation:** Recursively tracks `docs/**/*.mdx` from the main repo.
- **Indexes Patterns:** Maintains embeddings of core architectural files (`db-interface.ts`, etc.).
- **External Feeds:** Syncs with Svelte 5 and Skeleton official documentation.

### 2. Client-Side Inference (Local LLM)

While the _Knowledge_ is remote, the _Inference_ (Generation) remains local and private by default using **Ollama**:

- **Privacy:** Your prompts and chat history stay on your server (except for the search query sent to the Knowledge Core).
- **Cost:** Uses local models (e.g., `ministral-3`, `llama3`) via Ollama.
- **Speed:** Zero-latency inference if running on GPU nodes.

### 3. The Flow

1. **User Query:** "How do I create a widget?"
2. **Context Retrieval:** `AIService` sends the query to `https://mcp.sveltycms.com/api/v1/query`.
3. **Augmentation:** The remote server returns relevant code snippets and docs.
4. **Generation:** `AIService` combines the snippets with the user prompt and feeds it to the local Ollama instance.

## Usage for Developers

### Setup

1. **Ollama:** Ensure `ollama serve` is running.
2. **Configuration:** (Optional) Set `AI_KNOWLEDGE_API_URL` in `private.ts` if using a self-hosted knowledge core. Defaults to `https://mcp.sveltycms.com`.

### Usage in Chat

The built-in Dashboard AI (SveltyAgent) automatically uses this architecture.
To use it programmatically:

```typescript
import { aiService } from '$services/AIService';

const reply = await aiService.chat('How do I add a new language?');
```

### 4. Real-Time Streaming (SSE)

SveltyCMS leverages a lightweight Server-Sent Events (SSE) architecture to stream AI responses directly to the user interface.

- **Infrastructure**: `api/events` endpoint broadcasts `eventBus` emissions.
- **Client Handling**: The `collaboration-store` manages the `EventSource` connection, buffering activity events and assembling streamed AI tokens in real-time.
- **AI Response Event**: The `ai:response` event carries partial tokens in `payload.data.text` and a completion flag in `payload.data.done`.

This ensures a responsive, "typing" experience for AI assistance without the overhead of WebSockets.

## WebMCP Support (Client-Side Agents)

SveltyCMS supports **WebMCP** (Web Model Context Protocol), a standard that allows browser-based AI agents (like Chrome AI, Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Desktop via browser connectors) to "discover" and "control" the CMS interface.

The implementation is a lightweight **Plugin** running entirely in the browser (`src/plugins/webmcp`). It polyfills `navigator.modelContext` and registers tools that AI agents can invoke.

### Available Tools

1.  **Content Management**:
    - `get_collections`: Lists all schemas and fields.
    - `search_content`: Finds entries in the database.
2.  **Navigation**:
    - `navigate_to`: Moves the user to a specific route.
    - `get_current_route`: Reports current location.

### Usage

No configuration is required. The plugin is automatically initialized in the Admin Dashboard. Open your browser's devtools console to see the initialization log:

```
[WebMCP] Initializing...
[WebMCP] Tools registered successfully.
```

## Legacy Webhooks vs. AI Integration

> [!NOTE]
> For traditional server-to-server notifications (e.g., triggering a static site rebuild), please refer to the **[HTTP Webhooks Guide](../../api/Webhooks.mdx)**. WebMCP is specifically for _active browser-based agents_ interacting with the UI.
