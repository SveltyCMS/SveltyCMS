# Access Management

SveltyCMS provides a robust **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system combined with granular permissions to secure your content and sensitive settings.

The Access Management dashboard is located at `/config/accessManagement`.

---

## 👥 Roles & Permissions

Users are assigned a **Role**, and Roles are assigned **Permissions**. This allows you to manage access for groups of users efficiently (e.g., "Editors", "Authors", "Admins").

### Admin Role

The **Admin** role is special. A role with the `isAdmin: true` flag has **all permissions enabled automatically**. You cannot modify individual permissions for an Admin role.

### Creating & Managing Roles

1.  Navigate to **Config > Access Management**.
2.  Click **Create New Role**.
3.  Enter a Role Name (e.g., "Content Editor") and optional Description.
4.  Toggle **Is Admin** if you want this role to have unrestricted access.

### Permission Matrix

For non-admin roles, you must explicitly grant permissions. The system organizes permissions into logical groups:

#### 1. Collection Permissions

Control access to specific content types.

- **read**: View entries in the collection.
- **create**: Add new entries.
- **update**: Edit existing entries.
- **delete**: Remove entries.
- **publish**: (If enabled) Publish/Unpublish entries.

#### 2. System Permissions

Control access to core system features:

- **User Management**: Create, edit, or delete users (`user:create`, `user:read`, etc.).
- **Configuration**: Access system settings, logs, and server info.
- **Content Management**: General content access (`content:files`, etc.).
- **Media Management**: Upload and manage files in the Media Library.
  - **Admins**: Can view, edit, and delete all media files in the system.
  - **Other Roles**: Are restricted to viewing and managing only the media they have personally uploaded (via the Media Gallery or MediaUpload widget).

- **Webhooks Management**: Configure and secure external HTTP triggers (`config:webhooks`).
- **API Access**: Permission to use system API endpoints (`api:read`, `api:write`).

> [!TIP]
> Changes to permissions take effect immediately for new requests, but users may need to refresh their session (logout/login) for UI elements to update fully.

## 🔑 Website Tokens

**Website Tokens** are persistent API keys designed for **machine-to-machine** communication. They are ideal for:

- Connecting your frontend website (Next.js, SvelteKit, etc.) to the CMS.
- Running automated build scripts.
- Third-party integrations.

### Website Tokens vs. User Tokens

| Feature         | Website Token               | User Token                  |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Server-side integration     | User authentication (Login) |
| **Expiration**  | Permanent (until revoked)   | Temporary (Session-based)   |
| **Permissions** | Scoped to specific actions  | Inherits User's Role        |
| **Creation**    | Manually generated in Admin | Generated via Login API     |

### Managing Website Tokens

1.  **Generate Token**:
    - Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Website").
    - Click **Generate**.
    - **Copy the token immediately**. For security, it is shown only once.

2.  **Usage**:
    - Include the token in the `Authorization` header of your API requests:
      ```bash
      Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
      ```

3.  **Revocation**:
    - Click **Delete** next to a token to immediately invalidate it. All applications using that token will lose access.

### Permissions for Tokens

You can now assign **Granular Permissions** to Website Tokens. By default, a token has **Read Only** access. During creation, you can select specific permissions (e.g., `user:create`, `collection:update`) to grant precise access rights.

### Token Expiration

For enhanced security, Website Tokens can have an expiration date:

- **30 Days** (Short-term)
- **90 Days** (Standard rotation)
- **1 Year** (Long-term integration)
- **Custom Date**
- **Never** (Use with caution)

Tokens nearing expiration (less than 7 days) are highlighted in the management table. Expired tokens are automatically rejected by the API.
