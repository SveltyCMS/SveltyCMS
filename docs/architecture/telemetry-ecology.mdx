# Security Updates & Ecosystem Health

SveltyCMS prioritizes the security of your installation. To achieve this, we use an Active Update Check system inspired by Drupal and WordPress.

## 1. The Security Check Mechanism

SveltyCMS does not "track" you in the traditional sense. Instead, your server periodically asks our central registry: "I am running version X on Node Y. Are there any known security vulnerabilities?"

### The Exchange

This is a mutually beneficial exchange:

- **You Get:** Immediate notification of security patches, vulnerability alerts, and feature updates directly in your Admin Dashboard.
- **We Get:** Anonymous aggregate data (Version, DB Type, Node Version) to help us prioritize development resources.

### Frequency & Reliability

The system is designed to be **unobtrusive and robust**:

- **Check Interval:** Once every **12 hours**.
- **Failure Handling:** If the update server is unreachable, the system **caches the failure timestamp** and waits another 12 hours before retrying. This prevents your server from "spamming" connection attempts or slowing down page loads.
- **Heartbeat:** A lightweight "heartbeat" signal is sent during system startup (`handleSystemState`) to register the instance's health status without blocking the boot process.

### "Security Status: Unknown"

If you disable this system, your Admin Dashboard will display a "Security Status: Unknown" warning.

- We cannot alert you to critical vulnerabilities.
- You are responsible for manually checking GitHub releases for security patches.

## 2. Privacy & Opt-Out

You retain full control. If you operate in a high-security air-gapped environment, you can disable these checks.

### Environment Variable (Hard Disable)

```bash
SVELTY_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true
```

### Admin Settings (Soft Disable)
Navigate to **Settings → Licensing & Compliance** and toggle "Disable Telemetry".

> **Note:** Disabling this service will turn off the automated security badge in your footer.

## 3. Fair Source Licensing (BSL 1.1)

This telemetry also helps us understand the "Economy" of our ecosystem to enforce our Fair Source license.

- **Small Business (<$1M):** Free forever.
- **Enterprise (>$1M):** Commercial license required.
