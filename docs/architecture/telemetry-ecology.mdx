# Security Updates & Ecosystem Health

SveltyCMS prioritizes the security of your installation. To achieve this, we use an Active Update Check system inspired by Drupal and WordPress.

## 1. The Security Check Mechanism

SveltyCMS does not "track" you in the traditional sense. Instead, your server periodically asks our central registry via a **Secure, Hashed ID**: "Attributes of this installation (Version X, Node Y). Are there any known vulnerabilities?"

### The Exchange

This is a mutually beneficial exchange:

- **You Get:** Immediate notification of security patches, vulnerability alerts, and feature updates directly in your Admin Dashboard.
- **We Get:** Anonymous aggregate data (Version, DB Type, Components Used) to help us prioritize development.

### How Identification Works (Privacy First)

We do **NOT** track your IP address as an identifier.
We do **NOT** read your content.

Instead, your CMS generates a unique **Installation ID** by hashing your private `JWT_SECRET_KEY`.

- **We see:** `a3f0..., 7b29...` (One-way hash).
- **We NEVER see:** Your actual specific key or domain ownership details unless publicly inferable.
- This ensures that if you move your site to a new server/IP, your history remains consistent, but unauthorized users cannot spoof your ID without your secret key.

### Data Collected

| Field           | Description            | Purpose                                         |
| :-------------- | :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Version**     | `0.5.0`                | Alerting for outdated/vulnerable versions.      |
| **Node.js**     | `v24.12.0`             | Determining minimal supported runtimes.         |
| **Environment** | `production`           | Separating test data from real usage.           |
| **Widgets**     | `['seo']`              | Understanding which widgets are most popular.   |
| **Metrics**     | `{ users: 15, ... }`   | Understanding scale (SaaS vs Enterprise usage). |
| **System**      | `{ cpus: 8, ram: 32 }` | Hardware profiling for BSL 1.1 enforcement.     |

## 1.5 Security Measures (Anti-Abuse)

To protect the integrity of the data and availability of the service:

- **Rate Limiting**: Each IP address is limited to **1 check per 12 hours** (enforced by client and server).
- **Payload Validation**: Strict checking of data types and lengths. Malformed JSON or over-sized payloads are rejected (400 Bad Request).
- **IP Anonymization**: IP addresses are hashed immediately and never stored in plain text.

## 2. Privacy & Opt-Out

You retain full control. If you operate in a high-security air-gapped environment, you can disable these checks.

### Environment Variable (Hard Disable)

```bash
SVELTYCMS_TELEMETRY=false
```

## 3. Server Implementation (Tech Spec)

### Endpoint

- **URL:** `https://telemetry.sveltycms.com/api/check-update`
- **Method:** `POST`

## 4. Fair Source Licensing (BSL 1.1)

This telemetry also helps us understand the "Economy" of our ecosystem to enforce our Fair Source license.

- **Small Business (<$1M):** Free forever.
- **Enterprise (>$1M):** Commercial license required.
