# System State & Health Architecture

SveltyCMS employs a robust **State Machine** to manage the application's lifecycle, ensure data integrity, and handle system failures gracefully. This system acts as a gatekeeper for all incoming requests.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

The system state is managed by a central store (`@stores/system`) and enforced by the `handleSystemState` server hook.

### System States

The application can be in one of the following states:

| State              | Description                                                       | Request Handling                                  |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **`IDLE`**         | Initial state. System is waiting for setup or initialization.     | **Blocked** (except Setup Wizard & Health Checks) |
| **`INITIALIZING`** | Database connection and core services are starting up.            | **Blocked** (requests wait for completion)        |
| **`READY`**        | Normal operational state. All systems go.                         | **Allowed**                                       |
| **`DEGRADED`**     | System is operational but some non-critical services are failing. | **Allowed** (with warning logs)                   |
| **`FAILED`**       | Critical failure (e.g., DB down). System cannot function.         | **Blocked** (503 Service Unavailable)             |

## 🛡️ Request Gating Middleware

The `handleSystemState` hook (`src/hooks/handleSystemState.ts`) intercepts every request to ensure the system is ready to handle it.

### Logic Flow

1.  **Health Checks & Static Assets**: Always allowed, regardless of state.
2.  **IDLE State (Setup Mode)**:
    - Checks if `isSetupComplete()`.
    - If **No**: Allows access to `/setup`, the setup **Server Functions** in `+page.server.ts`, and `/login`. Blocks others.
    - If **Yes**: Triggers initialization and transitions to `INITIALIZING`.
3.  **INITIALIZING State**:
    - Pauses incoming requests until initialization completes (or times out).
    - If initialization succeeds -> Proceeds to `READY`.
    - If initialization fails -> Transitions to `FAILED` and returns 503.
4.  **FAILED State**:
    - Blocks all traffic with a 503 error.
    - _Exception_: In `TEST_MODE`, requests may be allowed with a warning to facilitate debugging.
5.  **READY / DEGRADED State**:
    - Allows request to proceed.
    - If `DEGRADED`, injects `event.locals.degradedServices` for UI notifications.

## 🧠 Implemented Advanced Features

### 1. Smart Self-Healing & Automatic Recovery

The system now includes a robust self-healing mechanism for initialization failures (e.g., temporary database outages):

- **Automatic Retry**: If initialization fails, the system enters a temporary `FAILED` state.
- **Cooldown Period**: Calls to the server during this state return a 503 error with a "Retrying in X seconds" message.
- **Auto-Recovery**: After a 5-second cooldown, the next request automatically triggers a fresh initialization attempt (resetting internal promises and connection states).

### 2. Lazy Initialization & Race Condition Prevention

To prevent "DB not connected" errors during the bootstrapping phase:

- **Lazy Proxies**: Database adapters and webhook wrappers use lazy property access (getters) rather than eager initialization. This ensures dependencies are only accessed _after_ a successful connection is established.
- **Order-of-Operations Safety**: The system is Architected to handle out-of-order module loading gracefully without crashing the startup sequence.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

1.  **Granular Sub-States**:
    - Instead of a global `INITIALIZING`, track `DB_CONNECTING`, `CACHE_WARMING`, `INDEX_BUILDING`.
    - Allow partial traffic (e.g., read-only) during specific sub-states.

2.  **Event-Driven Transitions**:
    - Move from polling/check-based transitions to an event bus architecture.
    - Example: `db:connected` event triggers transition to `CACHE_WARMING`.

3.  **Circuit Breakers**:
    - Automatically disable specific widgets or API endpoints if their dependent services fail, keeping the rest of the site `READY`.
