# SveltyCMS Architecture Documentation

Welcome to the SveltyCMS architecture documentation. This section provides a comprehensive technical overview of the system's design, patterns, and implementation details.

## 🚀 Recommended Reading Path

For new developers, we recommend reading these documents in order to build a strong understanding of the SveltyCMS architecture:

1.  **[Code Structure & Organization](./code-structure.mdx)**: Start here for a high-level overview of the codebase.
2.  **[Server Hooks & Middleware](./server-hooks.mdx)**: Understand how requests are processed.
3.  **[System State & Health](./state-management.mdx)**: Learn about the application's lifecycle and health monitoring.
4.  **[Database Core Infrastructure](/docs/database/Core_Infrastructure.mdx)**: Dive into the database-agnostic adapter pattern.
5.  **[System Settings Architecture](./system-settings-architecture.mdx)**: See how dynamic configuration is managed.
