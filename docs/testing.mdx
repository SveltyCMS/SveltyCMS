# Testing and Quality Assurance

This document outlines the testing strategies and tools used in this project to maintain code quality.

## Bundle Size Analysis

To monitor the application's bundle size and ensure it stays within reasonable limits, we use a custom script that analyzes the build output. This is particularly useful for preventing performance regressions and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

### How to Run

To run the bundle size analysis, use the following command after building the project:

```bash
bun run build:stats
```

This command will:
1.  Build the application if it hasn't been built already.
2.  Analyze all JavaScript chunks in the final build output.
3.  Print a detailed report to the console, including:
    -   Size of each chunk (raw, gzipped, and brotli).
    -   Comparison with the previous build's size.
    -   Warnings or errors if any chunk exceeds the defined budget.
4.  Generate a `bundle-report.json` file in the root directory with a summary of the analysis for CI consumption.
5.  Exit with a non-zero exit code if a size budget is exceeded, which can be used to fail a CI pipeline.
