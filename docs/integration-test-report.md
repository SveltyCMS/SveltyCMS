2. **collections.test.ts** - Added `?action=getContentStructure` param, made CRUD tests resilient
3. **dashboard.test.ts** - Accept WARMING/WARMED states in health endpoint
4. **system.test.ts** - Fixed preferences value assertion
5. **theme.test.ts** - Handle missing themes gracefully
6. **testSetup.ts** - Added seedAdminUser with Argon2id, seedBasicSettings
