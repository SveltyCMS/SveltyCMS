# HTTP Webhooks Guide

SveltyCMS provides a robust, secure HTTP webhook system that allows you to trigger external systems whenever content or media changes occur.

> [!TIP]
> **Looking for WebSockets?** If you prefer a persistent connection for real-time updates, check out our **[GraphQL Subscriptions](graphql-api.mdx)**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Legacy System Notice**: While HTTP Webhooks are fully supported, we recommend using the **[GUI Automation System](../guides/automation-system.mdx)** for new integrations. Automations offer multi-step logic, condition filtering, and built-in **[Email Notifications](../guides/email-system.mdx)** that legacy webhooks do not support.

Unlike GraphQL subscriptions which require a persistent WebSocket connection, Webhooks use standard HTTP POST requests, making them ideal for serverless functions, CI/CD pipelines, and third-party integrations (e.g., Zapier, IFTTT).

## 🚀 Getting Started

To manage your webhooks, navigate to **Settings > Webhooks** in the SveltyCMS admin panel.

### Adding a Webhook

1. Click **Add Webhook**.
2. **Name**: Provide a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Static Site Rebuild").
3. **Payload URL**: The external endpoint that will receive the `POST` requests.
4. **Secret Key**: A unique string used to sign the request. You can regenerate this at any time.
5. **Trigger Events**: Select one or more events that should trigger this webhook.

### Testing Connectivity

Use the **Test** button on any configured webhook to send a sample payload to your endpoint. This is the fastest way to verify your integration logic and HMAC verification.

---

## 🔒 Security & Verification

All webhooks sent by SveltyCMS include security headers to ensure the request is authentic and has not been tampered with.

### HMAC Signature

Every request includes an `X-SveltyCMS-Signature` header containing a **SHA-256 HMAC hex digest** of the raw request body, using your webhook's secret key.

**Verification Example (Node.js):**

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, secret) {
	const expectedSignature = 'sha256=' + crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(payload).digest('hex');

	return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(signature), Buffer.from(expectedSignature));
}
```

### Request Headers

| Header                  | Description                                     |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `X-SveltyCMS-Event`     | The type of event (e.g., `entry:publish`)       |
| `X-SveltyCMS-Delivery`  | A unique UUID for this specific delivery        |
| `X-SveltyCMS-Timestamp` | Unix timestamp of the dispatch                  |
| `X-SveltyCMS-Signature` | HMAC-SHA256 signature (prefixed with `sha256=`) |

## 📡 Event Reference

SveltyCMS triggers webhooks for the following events:

### Content Events

| Event             | Trigger                                                          |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entry:create`    | A new entry is created in a collection.                          |
| `entry:update`    | An existing entry is saved or modified.                          |
| `entry:delete`    | An entry is deleted.                                             |
| `entry:publish`   | An entry's status is changed to "publish".                       |
| `entry:unpublish` | An entry's status is changed from "publish" to any other status. |

### Media Events

| Event          | Trigger                                      |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `media:upload` | A new file is uploaded to the media gallery. |
| `media:delete` | A file is deleted from the media gallery.    |

## 📦 Payload Structure

The payload sent is a JSON object with the following schema:

```json
{
	"event": "entry:publish",
	"timestamp": "2026-02-03T21:44:55.123Z",
	"webhookId": "uuid-of-webhook",
	"deliveryId": "uuid-for-this-delivery",
	"payload": {
		"collection": "Posts",
		"id": "64f1...",
		"data": {
			"title": "Hello World",
			"status": "publish",
			"...": "..."
		}
	}
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> For `delete` events, the payload typically only contains the `id` and `collection` name as the data no longer exists.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **5-Second Timeout**: SveltyCMS expects your endpoint to respond within 5 seconds. Long-running tasks should be queued on your end.
- **Async Dispatch**: Webhooks are dispatched in the background and do not block CMS user actions.
- **Failures**: If an endpoint returns a non-2xx status code, it will be logged in the system as a failure.
