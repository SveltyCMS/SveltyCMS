# WebMCP Support (Client-Side Agents)

SveltyCMS now supports **WebMCP** (Web Model Context Protocol), a standard that allows browser-based AI agents (like Chrome AI, Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Desktop via browser connectors) to "discover" and "control" the CMS interface.

## How it Works

The implementation is a lightweight **Plugin** running entirely in the browser. It polyfills `navigator.modelContext` and registers tools that AI agents can invoke.

### Available Tools

1.  **Content Management**:
    - `get_collections`: Lists all schemas and fields.
    - `search_content`: Finds entries in the database.
2.  **Navigation**:
    - `navigate_to`: Moves the user to a specific route.
    - `get_current_route`: Reports current location.

## Architecture

This feature is implemented as a native plugin: `src/plugins/webmcp`.

For deep technical details on the underlying AI architecture, please refer to:
[AI Integration & RAG Architecture](guides/development/ai-integration.mdx)

## Usage

No configuration is required. The plugin is automatically initialized in the Admin Dashboard. Open your browser's devtools console to see the initialization log:

```
[WebMCP] Initializing...
[WebMCP] Tools registered successfully.
```
