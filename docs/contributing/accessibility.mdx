# Accessibility Guide

SveltyCMS strives to be accessible to all users. We strictly enforce **WCAG 2.2 AA** for compliance testing, but we **always aim for WCAG 3.0 (Functional Performance)** principles. This means prioritizing the actual human experience—cognitive load, error recovery, and clear navigation—over simple checkbox compliance.

## WCAG 3.0 First: Cognitive & Functional Focus

When building features, ask "Does this work for everyone?" before "Does it pass the validator?".

- **Clear Language**: Use plain English. Avoid jargon.
- **Error Prevention**: Help users fix mistakes (e.g., "Password must contain..." instead of "Invalid password").
- **Consistent Navigation**: predictable patterns across the app.

## WCAG 2.2 AA Checklist

When developing new features, ensure:

- [ ] **Color Contrast**: Text has at least 4.5:1 contrast against its background. Large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold) needs 3:1.
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard.
  - Focus order is logical.
  - Focus indicators are visible (do not remove `outline` without replacement).
- [ ] **Screen Reader Support**:
  - Interactive elements have accessible names (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, or visible text).
  - Status changes are announced via `aria-live` regions.
  - Page structure uses HTML5 landmarks (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`).
- [ ] **Forms**:
  - All inputs have associated labels (`<label for="...">`).
  - Error messages are associated with inputs via `aria-describedby`.
  - Required fields are marked with `required` or `aria-required="true"`.

## Future-Proofing: WCAG 3.0 (Draft)

While **WCAG 2.2 AA** is our current strict compliance target, SveltyCMS aspires to the emerging **WCAG 3.0** principles (Functional Performance). To support this modernization:

- **Focus on functional outcomes**, not just technical pass/fail. Does the feature _work_ for users with disabilities?
- **Cognitive Accessibility**: Pay extra attention to clear language, consistent navigation, and error prevention, which are emphasized more heavily in WCAG 3.0.
- **Holistic Rating**: We aim for an overall accessible experience, prioritizing critical user flows (Login, Content Creation, Setup).

## ATAG 2.0 (Authoring Tool) Requirements

Since SveltyCMS is an authoring tool (CMS), we must support authors with disabilities:

1.  **Accessible UI**: The admin interface itself must be accessible (covered by WCAG).
2.  **Support Accessible Content Creation**:
    - Prompt users to add alt text for images.
    - Ensure generated content relies on semantic HTML.
    - Preserve accessibility information when pasting/importing content.

## Setup Wizard Specific Patterns

The Setup Wizard (`src/routes/setup`) uses specific patterns for accessibility:

### Live Regions

Use `aria-live="polite"` for status messages that appear dynamically without page reload.

```svelte
<div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
	{#if message}{message}{/if}
</div>
```

### Focus Management

When using multi-step forms or wizards, move focus programmatically to the new content container when the step changes. This ensures screen reader users are aware of the new context.

```typescript
import { tick } from 'svelte';

async function nextStep() {
	currentStep++;
	await tick();
	document.getElementById('step-content')?.focus();
}
```

### Modals

Modals must:

- Have `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`.
- Trap focus within the modal.
- Close on `Escape` key.
- Return focus to the trigger element on close.

## Testing

Before submitting PRs:

1.  **Keyboard Test**: Tab through the interface. Can you do everything without a mouse?
2.  **Zoom Test**: Zoom to 200%. Does the layout break?
3.  **Automated Test**: Run any available accessibility linters or audit tools (e.g., Lighthouse, Axe).
