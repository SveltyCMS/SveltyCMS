# .github/workflows/playwright.yml
# 
# CURRENT: Tests run against MongoDB only
# FUTURE: Will use matrix strategy to test against multiple databases in parallel:
#   - MongoDB (current)
#   - PostgreSQL (via Drizzle ORM)
#   - MariaDB (via Drizzle ORM)
#   - MySQL (via Drizzle ORM)
# 
# Example future matrix configuration:
#   strategy:
#     matrix:
#       database: [mongodb, postgresql, mariadb, mysql]
#     include:
#       - database: mongodb
#         db_image: mongo:latest
#       - database: postgresql
#         db_image: postgres:16
#       - database: mariadb
#         db_image: mariadb:11
#       - database: mysql
#         db_image: mysql:8
