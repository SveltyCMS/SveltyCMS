## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅

- **Setup wizard:** Isolated app, won't affect main CMS
- **Theme package:** Just CSS, easy to test
- **OKLCH colors:** Already validated in your theme
- **Rollback:** Easy, just don't use the package yet

### Medium Risk ⚠️

- **Main CMS migration:** ~150 files to update
- **Component changes:** v4 has different APIs
- **Testing required:** Full regression testing needed
- **Mitigation:** Setup wizard proves approach first

### High Risk ❌

- **None!** The two-phase approach eliminates high-risk scenarios

---

## Key Technical Decisions

### ✅ Decision: OKLCH Colors

**Why:** Your theme already used them! No conversion needed.  
**Impact:** Zero visual changes, perfect compatibility with v4.

### ✅ Decision: Separate Package

**Why:** Reusable, testable, maintainable.  
**Impact:** Both apps can share, update once affects all.

### ✅ Decision: Setup Wizard First

**Why:** Lower risk, validates approach, isolated testing.  
**Impact:** Main CMS stays stable while we test v4.

### ✅ Decision: CSS-First Config

**Why:** Tailwind v4 best practice, simpler than JS config.  
**Impact:** Fewer files, better IDE support.

### ✅ Decision: Keep Gradients

**Why:** Part of your brand, work with both v3 and v4.  
**Impact:** No visual changes, gradients preserved perfectly.

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Will the CMS look different?**  
A: No! Same colors, same styles, just better technology underneath.

**Q: Do I need to change colors?**  
A: No! Your OKLCH colors are perfect and preserved exactly.

**Q: Is this safe?**  
A: Very safe! Setup wizard tests everything before main CMS touches v4.

**Q: How much work?**  
A: Setup wizard: 1-2 weeks. Main CMS: 5-7 days (after setup wizard validates).

**Q: What if something breaks?**  
A: Setup wizard is isolated. Main CMS stays on v3 until we're 100% confident.

**Q: Can I help?**
