Overview
The Date field provides a user-friendly calendar interface for selecting a specific date. It can also be configured to include a time picker for situations where the exact time of day is important, such as for an event or a publication schedule.
All dates are stored in a standardized UTC format to ensure there is no confusion between timezones.
Usage (for Content Editors)
When editing content, you will see a field that looks like a standard text input but shows a calendar icon. Clicking on the field or the icon will open your browser's native date picker interface.

- Date-Only Field: A calendar will appear, allowing you to select a year, month, and day.
- Date & Time Field: After selecting a date, an additional interface will appear allowing you to select the hour and minute.
  Configuration (for Developers)
  The DateWidget is highly versatile. Its primary configuration option is the timePicker property, which toggles between a date-only and a date-time input.
  Example Configuration
  Here is how you would set up a "Publication Date" (date only) and an "Event Start" (date and time).
  import { DateWidget } from '@src/widgets';

const EventSchema = {
// ... other fields
publish_date: DateWidget({
label: 'Publication Date',
required: true,
helper: 'The date this article will go live.'
}),
event_start: DateWidget({
label: 'Event Start Time',
timePicker: true, // This enables the time input
required: true,
helper: 'The exact date and time the event begins.'
})
};

All Configuration Properties
| Property | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| label | string | - | Required. The display name for the field in the CMS. |
| required | boolean | false | If true, the field cannot be empty. |
| timePicker | boolean | false | If true, adds a time selection input to the date picker. |
| helper | string | - | Help text displayed below the field to guide the user. |
| minDate | string | - | The earliest date that can be selected. Use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., '2025-01-01'). |
| maxDate | string | - | The latest date that can be selected. Use YYYY-MM-DD format. |
| displayFormat | 'short', 'medium', 'long', 'full' | 'medium' | Controls how the date is formatted in list views. |
Data Structure
All dates and times are saved as a standardized UTC ISO 8601 string. This ensures that the data is unambiguous and can be easily parsed and formatted on any front end.
If timePicker: false: The date is stored at midnight UTC.
{
"publish_date": "2025-10-26T00:00:00.000Z"
}

If timePicker: true: The date and selected time are stored in UTC.
{
"event_start": "2025-11-15T18:30:00.000Z"
}
