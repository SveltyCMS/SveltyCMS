**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Context:** Evaluating SveltyCMS theme against modern enterprise CMS standards

---

## Modern CMS Theme Standards

### Drupal Gin Theme (83,856+ installations)

**Key Features:**

- ‚úÖ **Dark mode first** - Primary interface is dark
- ‚úÖ **Neutral color palette** - Blues/grays, professional
- ‚úÖ **High contrast** - Excellent readability
- ‚úÖ **Accent color system** - Blue accent (#0078f0 similar to our tertiary)
- ‚úÖ **Focus color** - Distinct from accent
- ‚úÖ **Layout density options** - Compact/comfortable/spacious
- ‚úÖ **Customizable** - User preferences

**Color Psychology:**

- **Primary UI:** Dark gray/charcoal (`#1a1a1a` - `#2a2a2a`)
- **Accent:** Blue (`#0073e6` - trust, professionalism)
- **Success:** Green (similar to ours)
- **Warning:** Amber (not bright yellow)
- **Error:** Red (destructive actions)

### Payload CMS

**Key Features:**

- ‚úÖ **Modern dark theme** - Primary interface
- ‚úÖ **Professional gray scale** - Neutral backgrounds

## SveltyCMS Current Theme Analysis

### Strengths ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ **OKLCH colors** - Modern, perceptually uniform
- ‚úÖ **Brand identity** - Green #5fd317 is distinctive
- ‚úÖ **Complete scales** - 50-950 for each color
- ‚úÖ **Dark mode ready** - Already configured
- ‚úÖ **Accessible contrast** - Good contrast ratios

### Concerns ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Green is unconventional for enterprise**
   - Most CMS use blue/gray (trust, neutrality)
   - Green often signals "success" or "environment"
   - Can be associated with "beginner" or "consumer" products
2. **Bright green primary**
   - `#5fd317` is quite vivid
   - May feel too "playful" for Fortune 500 companies
   - Could fatigue users in long admin sessions

3. **Gray secondary is good**
   - Neutral, professional
   - But could be the primary in enterprise

4. **Blue tertiary is underused**
   - `#0078f0` matches Gin theme
   - Should be more prominent
