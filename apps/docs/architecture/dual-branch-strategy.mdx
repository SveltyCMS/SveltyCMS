# SveltyCMS Dual-Branch Strategy

This document explains the dual-branch strategy for SveltyCMS, which separates end-user simplicity from developer power.

---

## Branch Structure

### `main` Branch - End Users (Production)

**Target**: CMS users who want a simple, ready-to-use CMS

**Contains**:

- ✅ `apps/cms/` - Main CMS application
- ✅ `apps/setup/` - Setup wizard
- ✅ `apps/shared-theme/` - Shared UI theme
- ✅ Root configuration files

**Excluded from main**:

- ❌ `apps/docs/` - Documentation site
- ❌ `apps/tests/` - Test suites
- ❌ `apps/scripts/` - Development scripts
- ❌ NX monorepo tooling
- ❌ Development workflows

**User Experience**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SveltyCMS/SveltyCMS.git
cd SveltyCMS
bun install
bun run dev
```

### `next` Branch - Developers (Full Monorepo)

**Target**: Open source contributors and advanced developers

**Contains**:

- ✅ `apps/cms/` - CMS application
- ✅ `apps/setup/` - Setup wizard (standalone)
- ✅ `apps/shared-theme/` - Shared theme
- ✅ `apps/docs/` - Documentation site (SvelteKit + MDX)
- ✅ `apps/tests/` - Test suites (Bun, Playwright)
- ✅ `apps/scripts/` - Utility scripts
- ✅ Full NX monorepo setup
- ✅ All development workflows
- ✅ CI/CD configurations

**Developer Experience**:

```bash
git clone -b next https://github.com/SveltyCMS/SveltyCMS.git
cd SveltyCMS
bun install

# Use NX for all operations
nx dev cms
nx dev docs
nx test tests
nx run scripts:bundle-stats
```

---

## Workspace Structure

```
SveltyCMS/                           # Workspace root
├── apps/
│   ├── cms/                         # Main CMS (both branches)
│   ├── setup/                       # Setup wizard (both branches)

└── README.md                        # Branch-specific instructions
```

---

## Package.json Workspaces

### Main Branch

```json
{
	"workspaces": ["apps/cms", "apps/setup", "apps/shared-theme"]
}
```

### Next Branch

```json
{
	"workspaces": ["apps/cms", "apps/setup", "apps/shared-theme", "apps/docs", "apps/tests", "apps/scripts"]
}
```

---

## NX Projects (next branch only)

All apps are NX projects with proper `project.json`:

| Project          | Description                                   | Port |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| **cms**          | Main CMS application                          | 5173 |
| **setup**        | Standalone setup wizard                       | 5173 |
| **shared-theme** | Shared Tailwind v4 + Skeleton v4 theme        | N/A  |
| **docs**         | SvelteKit documentation with MDX              | 5174 |
| **tests**        | Bun and Playwright tests                      | N/A  |
| **scripts**      | Utility scripts (bundle-stats, check-mongodb) | N/A  |

---

## Shared Theme Strategy

All apps use the same theme from `apps/shared-theme/`:

**Shared Dependencies** (in shared-theme):

- Tailwind CSS v4
- Skeleton Labs v4
- ParaglideJS (i18n)
- Shared color palette
- Typography settings
- Component presets

**Apps Import Theme**:

```typescript
// In apps/cms/tailwind.config.ts
import sharedConfig from '../shared-theme/tailwind.config';

export default {
	...sharedConfig,
	content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,svelte,ts}', '../shared-theme/**/*.{html,js,svelte,ts}']
};
```

---

## Release Strategy

### Main Branch Releases

- **Semantic versioning** based on commits
- **Auto-release** via GitHub Actions
- **Clean structure** - Only production code
- **Simple updates**: Users just `git pull`

### Next Branch Development

- **All features** developed here first
- **Full testing** with NX
- **Documentation** updates
- **Merge to main** when stable

---

## Migration Path

### From main to next (for developers)

```bash
# Switch to development branch
git fetch origin
git checkout next
bun install

# Run multiple apps
nx run-many --target=dev --projects=cms,docs
```

### From next to main (for releases)

```bash
# Merge tested changes to production
git checkout main
git merge next --no-ff

# GitHub Actions auto-releases
# Semantic versioning based on commit messages
```

---

## File Organization Rules

### Must be in Both Branches

- `apps/cms/` - Core CMS
- `apps/setup/` - Setup wizard
- `apps/shared-theme/` - UI theme
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- `.github/workflows/auto-release.yaml` - Release automation

### Next Branch Only

- `apps/docs/` - Documentation
- `apps/tests/` - Tests
- `apps/scripts/` - Dev scripts
- `nx.json` - NX configuration
- `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`
- `.github/workflows/docs-lint.yml`

---

## Benefits

### For End Users (main)

- ✅ Simple structure
- ✅ Fast clone/install
- ✅ No dev tooling overhead
- ✅ Clear documentation
- ✅ Easy updates
- ✅ ~500KB smaller (no setup embedded in CMS)

### For Developers (next)

- ✅ Full NX monorepo benefits
- ✅ Comprehensive testing
- ✅ Documentation site
- ✅ Utility scripts
- ✅ Advanced workflows
- ✅ Better DX (Developer Experience)

---

## Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch

- ✅ Requires PR reviews
- ✅ Requires status checks
- ✅ Auto-release on merge
- ✅ Protected from force push

### Next Branch

- ✅ Requires PR reviews
- ✅ Requires tests to pass
- ✅ Allows force push (for maintainers)
- ✅ Continuous integration

---

## Questions?

- **Main branch issues**: Use for CMS bugs and user-facing features
- **Next branch issues**: Use for dev tooling, docs, tests, monorepo structure
- **Discussions**: For questions, ideas, and feature requests
- **Documentation**: Check `apps/docs/` in next branch

## Summary

**Main**: Simple CMS for users  
**Next**: Full monorepo for developers  
**Result**: Best of both worlds! 🚀

This dual-branch strategy allows SveltyCMS to:

- Remain accessible to end users who want simplicity
- Provide powerful development tools for contributors
- Keep bundle sizes optimized (standalone setup wizard)
- Maintain comprehensive testing and documentation
- Scale development without complicating deployment
