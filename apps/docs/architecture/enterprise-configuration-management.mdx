# Enterprise Configuration Management

This document outlines the architecture for the SveltyCMS configuration management system. It's inspired by Drupal's robust CEX/CIM workflow and is designed to provide a reliable, version-controllable, and developer-friendly way to manage the site's entire structure. The primary goal is to treat the site's structure as code.

## Core Principles

The entire system is built on three foundational principles:

1.  **‚öôÔ∏è Configuration as Code:** Every piece of site structure (collections, roles, widget states, etc.) is represented by a version-controllable JSON file in the Git repository. The filesystem is the **source of truth**.

2.  **üÜî UUIDs are Everything:** All configuration entities are identified by a `uuidv4`. This is the non-negotiable key that allows the system to track the same entity across different environments (dev, staging, live) regardless of database IDs.

3.  **üîÑ All Changes are Explicit:** The system never makes changes blindly. A **diffing** mechanism always compares the "source" (files) with the "active" (database) configuration and presents a clear summary of what will be **created, updated, or deleted**. The user must confirm these changes before they are applied.

## The "Smart Bridge": Handling Dependencies

A critical feature is the ability to manage dependencies between structural code (e.g., a widget) and environment-specific secrets (e.g., API keys stored in System Settings).

<Callout type="info">
	**Example:** A developer adds a `MapboxWidget` to the codebase. This widget requires a `MAPBOX_API_KEY` to function, which is a secret stored as a
	System Setting in the database.
</Callout>

The system bridges this gap in three steps:

1.  **Declare Dependencies:** The widget's code declares its required settings in a `_requiredSettings` property.
2.  **"Install Hook" on Import:** When the new widget is imported, the system reads its `_requiredSettings` and automatically creates a placeholder entry in the `system_settings` table if one doesn't exist.
3.  **Application Health Check:** A "Status Report" page in the CMS continuously validates that all required settings have non-empty values, alerting the admin and providing a direct link to the settings page if a key is missing.

## Architecture & Workflows

The system is composed of a filesystem structure, a unified API, and a service layer, supporting two distinct workflows.

### Filesystem Structure (`/config/sync/`)

All exported configuration lives in a structured, version-controllable directory.

- `/collections/[name].[uuid].json`
- `/roles/[name].[uuid].json`
- `/system/widget.state.json`
- `/system/theme.state.json`

### The Unified API (`/api/config_sync`)

A single, secure endpoint orchestrates all actions:

- **`GET /status`:** Runs the "diff" algorithm and reports on new, updated, and deleted entities, as well as any unmet requirements.
- **`POST /export`:** Writes the current active configuration from the database to the filesystem.
- **`POST /import`:** Applies the configuration from the filesystem to the database, respecting dependencies.

### The Two Workflows

1.  **Development (Hot Sync):** Powered by your `vite.config.ts`, this provides a real-time "inner loop." When a developer changes a config file, the Vite watcher instantly triggers the compiler and reloads the server, providing immediate feedback.
2.  **Deployment (Cold Sync):** Powered by the `/api/config_sync` endpoint, this provides a robust "outer loop." It's used by CI/CD pipelines or admins to bring a staging or production environment's database into perfect alignment with the codebase.
