# CMS/Setup Split - Reality Check

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Goal:** Separate setup wizard from CMS to reduce bundle size  
**Result:** Working, but simpler than documented

---

## ✅ What Actually Works

### 1. NX Monorepo Structure

```
SveltyCMS/
├── apps/
│   ├── cms/              ✅ Main CMS app
│   ├── setup-wizard/     ✅ Setup app
│   ├── docs/             ✅ Documentation site
│   └── shared-utils/     ✅ Shared utilities
├── config/               ✅ Shared config (workspace root)
└── compiledCollections/  ✅ Shared collections
```

**Status:** ✅ Working  
**Benefit:** Clean separation of concerns

### 2. Setup-Wizard Imports from CMS

**Configuration:**

```javascript
// apps/setup-wizard/svelte.config.js
alias: {
  '@src': '../cms/src',           // CMS source
  '@stores': '../cms/src/stores', // CMS stores
  '@components': '../cms/src/components',
  '@databases': '../cms/src/databases',
  '@services': '../cms/src/services'
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Working  
**Reality:** Setup-wizard directly imports from CMS (not isolated)  
**Benefit:** No code duplication, simpler maintenance

### 3. Shared Styling - Tailwind v3 + Skeleton v2

**Both apps use:**

- Tailwind v3.4.18
- Skeleton v2.11.0
- Same theme/styling

**Status:** ✅ Working  
**Reality:** No v4 migration, both on legacy stack  
**Benefit:** Stable, no compatibility issues

### 4. Separate Dev Servers

```bash
# CMS (port 5173)
cd apps/cms && bun dev

# Setup (port 5178)
cd apps/setup-wizard && bun dev
```

**Status:** ✅ Working  
**Benefit:** Can develop independently

---

## ❌ What Failed

### 1. Tailwind v4 + Skeleton v4 Migration

**Attempted:**

- Created `apps/shared-theme` package
- Migrated to Tailwind v4 CSS-first config
- Attempted Skeleton v4 migration

**Why Failed:**

- Skeleton v4 not compatible with Tailwind v4 yet
- `@variant` directive doesn't exist in Tailwind v4
- Module resolution issues with skeleton-svelte v4

**Lesson:** Don't adopt bleeding-edge versions mid-project

### 2. True Independence for Setup-Wizard

**Attempted:**

- Setup-wizard with own stores
- Setup-wizard with own components
- Consolidated setupStore

**Why Failed:**

- Over-complicated the architecture
- Created import path confusion
- Broke working code for minimal benefit

**Reality:** Setup importing from CMS works fine!

### 3. Multiple Store Consolidation

**Attempted:**

- Merge themeStore, setupStore, globalSettings into one
- Simplify state management

**Why Failed:**

- Components still reference old stores
- Import paths broke
- Not actually simpler

**Lesson:** If it ain't broke, don't fix it

### 4. Enterprise Theme Strategy

**Attempted:**

- Blue primary (enterprise standard)
- Green tertiary (brand)
- OKLCH color analysis
- v0.2.0 theme package

**Why Failed:**

- Over-engineered for no user benefit
- Theme works fine as-is
- Color psychology doesn't matter for internal CMS

**Lesson:** Focus on functionality, not marketing

### What We Don't Have (Failed)

| Attempted               | Failed | Reason                   |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| **Tailwind v4**         | ❌     | Skeleton v4 incompatible |
| **Skeleton v4**         | ❌     | Module resolution issues |
| **True Independence**   | ❌     | Over-complicated         |
| **Theme Package**       | ❌     | Not needed               |

## 🎯 Real Benefits Achieved

### 1. Code Organization ✅

- CMS code in `apps/cms/`
- Setup code in `apps/setup-wizard/`
- Shared utilities in `apps/shared-utils/`
- Clear boundaries

### 2. Development Workflow ✅

- Run CMS independently
- Run setup independently
- No interference between apps

### 3. NX Task Orchestration ✅

```bash
bun x nx run cms:dev        # Just CMS
bun x nx run setup-wizard:dev  # Just setup
bun x nx run-many --target=dev # All apps
```

### 4. Shared Config at Root ✅

- `config/` directory shared
- `compiledCollections/` shared
- No duplication

---

## 🚫 What to Stop Doing

### 1. Stop Chasing Latest Versions

- Tailwind v3 works fine
- Skeleton v2 is stable
- Don't migrate for sake of migrating

### 2. Stop Over-Engineering

- Setup importing from CMS is fine
- No need for "true independence"
- Shared code is good, not bad

### 3. Stop Creating Packages for Everything

- No need for theme package
- No need for UI package
- Keep it simple

### 4. Stop Documenting Failures

- 31 docs in `apps/docs/todo/`
- Most document failed attempts
- Keep only what works

---

## ✅ What Actually Matters

### For Users

1. Setup wizard works
2. CMS works
3. Both are stable

### For Developers

1. Clear code organization
2. Independent development
3. Shared utilities work

### For Production

1. Same bundle size (no v4 savings)
2. Same performance

## 💡 Bottom Line

**What We Wanted:**

- Cutting-edge stack (Tailwind v4 + Skeleton v4)
- True independence (setup-wizard isolated)
- Massive bundle reduction (61.9%)
- Perfect architecture

**What We Got:**

- Stable stack (Tailwind v3 + Skeleton v2)
- Pragmatic setup (imports from CMS)
- Clean organization (NX monorepo)
- Working system

**Verdict:** Success, just not the way we planned. Ship it.

## 🗑️ Documentation Cleanup Plan

### Keep (6 docs)

1. This document (CMS_SETUP_SPLIT_REALITY_CHECK.md)
2. NX_MONOREPO_ARCHITECTURE_FIXED.md (working architecture)
3. SETUP_WIZARD_README.md (if updated to reality)
4. QUICK_START.md (docs site)
5. BASELINE_METRICS.md (historical baseline)
6. INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md (if accurate)

### Archive (25 docs)

- All "TODO" docs
- All failed migration plans
- All v4 theme docs
- All "achievement" docs
- All "strategy" docs

**Create:** `apps/docs/archive/failed-attempts/` for learning

---

**Remember:** Working code > perfect docs. Ship what works.
